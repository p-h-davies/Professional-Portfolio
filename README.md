# Professional-Portfolio
A portfolio showcasing my strongest projects as well as the thought processes behind them.


## Description

This website was created so potential employers and clients can easily view my web development work and GitHub processes. It features a a main header, with a large abstract image being placed behind my name and the main navigation. Then, the first section of contact is an 'About Me' section, whilst the second and third area provide my portfolio and contact details respectively. The project area allows visitors to click on an image of a project, taking them to the deployed site, and provides visitors a brief descripton of each project. The contact area provides links which visitors can click to be taken to my GitHub/email. Underneath, there is a footer stating the creator of the site (me).
